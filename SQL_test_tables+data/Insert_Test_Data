   STEP 2: SCRIPTS TO INSERT DATA INTO THE TEST TABLES
   This document includes a scripts to create two dummy tables (dummy_article and dummy_topic),
   so that we can test functionality of MySQL and PHP using a clean set of data. The structure of the
   two tables parallels that of the "real" tables for our project (or at least as it stands now!).
   Create the tables first! And then use the scripts in "Insert_Test_Data" to insert data
   into the two tables once you have created them.
