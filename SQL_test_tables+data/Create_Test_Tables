   STEP 1: CREATE TWO TEST TABLES
   This document includes a scripts to create two dummy tables (dummy_article and dummy_topic),
   so that we can test functionality of MySQL and PHP using a clean set of data. The structure of the
   two tables parallels that of the "real" tables for our project (or at least as it stands now!).
   Create the tables first! And then use the scripts in "Insert_Test_Data" to insert data
   into the two tables once you have created them.

   Another note: I used the same database for these tables as the database we're currently using,
   if we want to keep our test data more separate, we create a database solely for testing.

pubdate DATETIME,

topic VARCHAR(55),
PRIMARY KEY(id),
UNIQUE INDEX(url) );
